* What's GraphQL?
[GraphiQL Explorer Demo]
* What are persisted queries?
[Precursor doc]
** Where are they used?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Apollo "optimistic" queries
- Solving for speed
- Only first request pays the price, then future users benefit
#+REVEAL: split
- Relay persisted query
#+REVEAL: split
Both initially solving the same thing:
Performance
#+REVEAL: split
... is there anything more though?
* Security
APIs are cool.

But a little (or much!) too powerful.

#+REVEAL: split
Stripe example:

Want to share two stats from Stripe internally for your company:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Monthly revenue
- Monthly refunds

... How do you expose *just* those two?
#+REVEAL: split
Other examples:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Contact form for Zendesk
- Party DJ Spotify control
- etc.

** Other benefits
- Security: Queries are locked down and can't be edited by unknown clients anymore.

Only variations can come from variables - means it's easy to lock down the exact semantics of each query.
#+REVEAL: split
- Cacheing: Because the query is locked down, cacheing is much easier.

What can change for a query?
- Variables
- Auth

Figuring out the cache-key is now trivial!
#+REVEAL: split
- Simplicity: Sending GraphQL query vs. hitting a single endpoint with json
* Demo
[Demo time!]
* Review
Persisted queries:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Size
- Speed
- Security
- Power
* Thank you!
